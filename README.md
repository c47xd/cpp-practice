These are the practice problems i did/doing .
# Practice 1 (else-if ladder) :

  Door 1 — The Prime Door  
  Opens only if A is prime and A < B.  
  If A is 1 or negative → auto-fail.  
  Door 2 — The Parity Trap  
  Opens if B and C have different parity (one even, one odd) AND (B + C) is divisible by 3  
  Door 3 — The “Devil’s XOR” Door Opens if exactly one of the following is true:  
  A > 50 , C is a perfect square , B is between 10 and 20 (inclusive)  
  If more than one is true → fails. If none true → fails.
